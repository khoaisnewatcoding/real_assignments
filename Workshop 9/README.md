This workshop and the assignment are by far the hardest thing I've done since I ever started coding so, thank you professor for making me and my team crying inside.

Anyways, in this exercise I've learned a lot. I have learned how to use string.h, create header files and implements the code into main.c. This workshop is indeed a challenge to me because it forced me to use my brain a lot. Looking at the example input, the task is to seperate each number and scan it into other variables. That is the hard part.However, with clear instructions, a lot of thinking and looking up online for help, i figured that i use the fgets() function to scan the line and then replace the new line char at the end of the string with a string terminator so i can keep parsing through the string. That is by far the hardest part in this code but fun after managing to pull it off.

In conclusion, this exercise helps me grasp a clearer concept of string manipulation while using struct to store data as well as using pointers to manipulate data. It strongly improve my skill and knowledge in coding and can further help me as a developer in the future.
