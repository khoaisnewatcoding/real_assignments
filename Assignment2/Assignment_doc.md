BTP 100—Introduction to Programming using C
Assignment #2
Assignment Topic: Pay Scale Comparison for Equity and Inclusion
The objective of this assignment is to create a program that compares a company's demographic
data on pay scales with Canadian averages, focusing on gender and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous,
and People of Color) representation. This assignment will reinforce programming concepts such
as functions, pointers, arrays, structs, iteration, selection, strings and data types.
This assignment challenges you to apply your C programming skills to analyze and compare
company data on pay scales with national averages, fostering a deeper understanding of equity
and inclusion issues in the workplace through quantitative analysis.


Tasks:
1. Struct Definition:
    a. Define a ‘Employee’ structure that includes the following fields:
        i. Employee ID (integer)
        ii. Name (string)
        iii. Gender (string)
        iv. Ethnicity (string)
        v. Salary (float)
2. Function Implementations:
    a. Implement functions to input employee data into an array of ‘Employee’
    structures.
    b. Implement functions to calculate average salaries based on gender and ethnicity
    for both the company and Canadian averages.
    c. Implement a function to display the comparison results.
3. Create an array of ‘Employee’ structures to store multiple employee records.
    a. Use pointer arithmetic to iterate through the array and access structure members.
4. Inclusion Features:
    a. Prompt the user to input employee data including gender, ethnicity, and salary.
    b. Compare company data with the following Canadian averages:
        i. Average salary for males, females, and non-binary individuals.
        ii. Average salary for BIPOC and non-BIPOC employees.
5. User Interface:
    a. Create a simple menu-driven interface using iterative constructs (loops) to allow
    users to input employee data, perform comparisons, and display the results.
    b. Ensure user inputs are validated (e.g., gender input should be limited to "male",
    "female", "non-binary", etc.).
6. Documentation and Reflection:
    a. Include comments in your code to explain each function and significant code
    block.
    b. Write a short report (100-200 words) on the importance of equity, diversity and
    inclusion in the workplace and how programming can contribute to analyzing and
    addressing these issues.
    c. This must be in APA format and must be submitted as a PDF file.


Submission Requirements:

1. Submit your C source code file(s) (.c files) along with a PDF containing your report.
2. Ensure your code is well-documented and adheres to C programming best practices.

Additional Notes:
Consider the ethical implications of handling sensitive demographic and salary data, ensuring
privacy and confidentiality in your program.

Grading Criteria
Programming Component (80%)
1. Functionality (40%)
    a. Input Handling: Correctly prompts the user for all required inputs.
    b. Calculations: Implements the specified formulae.
2. Code Quality (20%)
    a. Readability: Code is well-structured, with meaningful variable names and
    appropriate use of comments explaining major steps or calculations.
    b. Error Handling: Handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., non-numeric inputs,
    zero or negative values where inappropriate).
3. Output (20%)
    a. Display Format: Outputs specified data in a clear, readable format.
    Report Submission in APA format (10%)
    Note: ChatGPT is easily detectable and not allowed. Even if you take little interest in this
    component of the assignment, it is important to practice writing and documentation, as well as
    following instructions.


1. Cover Page (2.5%)
    a. Includes the names and student numbers of all group members.
2. Description of DEI and its importace (2.5%)
    a. Clearly explains what a carbon footprint is, why it is important, and what factors
    influence it (transportation, housing, consumption).
3. Comments on Code Contribution and Functionality (5%)
    a. Specifies which parts of the code each group member worked on, demonstrating
    collaboration and contribution from all members.
    b. Briefly describes the functionality of the code.
    
Grading Scale
- A (90-100%): Excellent implementation with accurate calculations, clear and well-commented
code, and comprehensive report submission.
- B (80-89%): Good implementation with minor errors or omissions in calculations or code
quality, but overall meets functional requirements.
- C (70-79%): Basic implementation that meets some functional requirements but lacks
thoroughness in calculations, code quality, or report submission.
- D (60-69%): Limited implementation with significant errors or omissions in calculations, code
quality, or report submission.
- F (Below 60%): Incomplete or incorrect implementation lacking essential components such as
correct calculations, functioning code, or complete report submission.
This rubric ensures that students are evaluated not only on their programming skills but also on
their ability to effectively communicate the environmental impact of personal actions and
promote sustainable practices.
