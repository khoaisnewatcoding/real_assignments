This C program is a simple Student Database Management System. Its main purpose is to manage student information, allowing users to add new students, display all students, and search for a student by their ID. In order to do all that, I have used data structure, functions, pointers, arrays, loops and if else statement.

Reflection:
- For data structure, I've learned that it can store datas, which is even more useful when you place it in an array to store more data. Kind of like a shelf of books.
- For pointers, I can't lie about how good and useful it was in coding.It's super useful in array handling and data structure access and modify. Using this can help me build powerful programs in the future.

- For loops and if statement, it helps me scan the database for the right condition. Moreover, it can be used to print grades in the grades array , super useful.

- Overall, this program is a great example that covers important programming concepts. Learning these concepts will help me as a software developer by improving my ability to design, create, and maintain software systems. Each part of the program gives me a good foundation for dealing with more complex programming tasks later on.
