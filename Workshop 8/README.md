In this program, strlen() is a function imported from string.h library and it is used to return the number of characters in the string before the null terminating character. strcpy() is used to copy the members from one char array to another char array. strcat() is used to combine the string from another array with the other array. From the math.h library, the function fabs() is used to return the absolute value of the number inside. rand() is function used to generate a random integer.

- In this exercise, I've grasped a much clearer concept of how these functions are utilized. They benefit greatly to me as I can visually my life less harder when it comes to copying string and caluclating how much words in a char array. Overall, learning these new things really help and boost my skill as a developer.
