The topics we've covered in the latest lab consists of pointers and direct struct accessibility and utilizing them in the argument. After observing the live demonstration and implementation on the knowledge, it allows me to understand their functionality and how efficient they are in a program code. By praticing these pointers and struct accessibility paired with arrays, I can make a code that have a firm database for each category I want. Overall, the exercise is not only a good demonstration of real application but also helped me as a student to be better and prepared for my future as a software developer.
