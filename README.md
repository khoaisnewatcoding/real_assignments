In this assignment I wrote a program that will print a list of my favorite movies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("This is a list of my favorite movies:\n");
    printf("-Avatar the Last Airbender\n");
    printf("-Jujutsu Kaisen\n");
    printf("-Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n");
    printf("-The Sandman\n");
    return 0;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Break down:
-"#include": This tells the preprocessor to insert the content of another file into the source code. Essentially, this step is mandatory because this program has basic functions in it
-"<stdio.h>": This is basically a library that contains the basic functions that this program needed to run.
--> So "#include <stdio.h>" is a compulsory step for the program to work. Without this step, the whole program and the function within that program will not run because the preprocessor does not know what the user is telling it to do.
-"int main()": Defines the starting point of the program code
- "{}": open and close, what is in the middle of the sharp brackets are just the instructions that I want the program to perform.
-"printf("...")": Prints what is inside the quote.
-"return 0": Basically, this means that the program executed sucessfully and the "0" means that there is no error.
-";": means that the code line is finished and ready to move onto the next line.
- "\n": removing the special characters or anything that may occur when the program runs.
