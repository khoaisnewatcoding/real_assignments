In workshop 4, I've written a code which comprises 2 parts
Part 1: It will prompt the user for 3 of your test scores and calculates the average score and determine the letter grade
- In this part one, I used if - else to devise into different scenarios. Because test score is grade out of 100, so it wouldn't make sense if one enters a negative number and number over 100. Therefore, if the user enters as such, the program will say "invalid" and terminates, preventing from causing any bugs.
Part 2: This section will prompt the user to enter their height and weight in order to calculate their BMI and decides if their weight range.
- Similar to part one, if the user enters any number less than 0 (including 0), the program will say "INVALID!" and terminates. Besides from improper inputs, the program will operate just like its intended purpose.

Reflection:
- Throughout this activity, I learned how to properly use if else, allowing me to understand it more and be more proficient in using it.
- I also found out that for if - else to work properly without any warnings and errors, it's safer to include curly brackets "{}" especially if it is more than a line.
- Overall, this excercise definitely emphasizes on the ultility of if - else. And by defining a scenario which user inputs an invalid value helps me avoid errors which plays a crucial role for my career. Additionally, by mainly using if - else in this program, it made me realize that if - else is simple to use yet very effective and can help me create programs that can handle different scenarios easily.
