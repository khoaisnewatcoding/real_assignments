-In this exercise, I wrote a code that prompts the user to enter how much students and how much grades per student the user wants to put in and calculates the average while determining the letter grade for each students.
-Throughout the exercise, I've learned how to utilize do while loops and for loops which ultimately gave em a better grasp at the concept. Moreover, I use if else to determine the letter grade, which helps me better my skill for the future.
- While using do while loop to get a valid input from user, I can see the robustness and usefulness in this function, which I will use a lot in the future.
