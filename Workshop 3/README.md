In workshop 3 I wrote a code that tells the user to enter the value and quantity for 3 items then prints the bill for all of them
These are what I've learned through this activity:
- If else statement, they helped me construct multiple scenarios in which the computer has to pick one in order to do what i want it to do when that scenario is true.
- However, in this activity, I couldn't tell whether if else or switch case is shorter so I picked the initial one and went with it.
- Moreover, I've also noticed that if else usually doesn't end with a semi-colon ";" which is quite interesting.
- Throughout this work, I also utilized scanf and printf much better and more proficient.
